Stonewrought_UI Version 00.001
August 04, 2019

From the mason’s of Iron Forge, I offer you Stonewrought UI. This addon seeks to restyle the default Blizzard interface in a Dwarven influenced style. Because the creation of this texture pack was lengthily process (and resulted in numerous thumbs being clobbered by hammers along the way), I ask that you contact me before using any portion of this addon in another texture pack or addon. Stonewrought UI will only be available on wowinterface for the time being.

Installation
Extract the Stonewrought_UI zip file and paste the contents of the "Interface" folder directly into your Interface folder.

Alternate Textures
There are some alternate textures that you can swap if you prefer (see shots). To do so, delete only the files that you intend to swap from the Interface folder, then replace them by pasting the alternate files into the Interface folder.

Example: delete the Minimap folder from the interface folder and replace it with the Minimap folder inside the Stonewrought_Alternate_Versions/Alternate Minimap_01 folder.

Updates
When updating from an older version of this addon, it is highly recommended that you delete all files created by this texture pack from your interface folder first.

Or, if you feel adventurous, you can read over the Change Log and then only delete and replace the files effected by the update.

Support
If any of these graphics do not appear to function properly, or you find any that are missing, feel free to use the comment section and let me know.
